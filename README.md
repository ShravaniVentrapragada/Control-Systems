Mathematical Modeling:

1. To learn mathematical modelling of mass-spring-damper system.

2. To generate transfer function for mass-spring-damper system in MATLAB.

3. To design a model in SIMULINK for the transfer function of mass-spring-damper system.

4. Observe the step response of mass-spring-damper system in MATLAB and SIMULINK.


Transfer Function: We have learnt the following functions in the above experiment. Transfer function to state-space conversion. [A,B,C,D] = tf2ss(NUM,DEN) calculates the state-space representation. similarly we used ss2tf. In the above experiment we learnt conversion of statespace models to transfer function and vice-versa and also ploted the step response on Simulink.


Root Locus: In the above experiment we learnt how to use the function rlocus and rlocfind which are very useful in plotting a root locus. We also observed damping ratio by applying grid on the plot obtained. We also calculated the angle of departure for a specific point by using trignometry and inserting a line at that angle.
